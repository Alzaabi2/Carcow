Best Salesmen in the Webster/Dudley area
March 10, 2023
By Dianne from Webster, MA
Owns this car
I needed a smaller car and Mark and Dan were very helpful. I told them what I can afford and they worked with me to get me a car. I love my new Toyota Corolla. I went to a few other dealers but no one could match what Toyota offered me. Thank You.
